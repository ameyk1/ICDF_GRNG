Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   470 out of  51,840    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 470
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        490 out of  51,840    1%
    Number used as logic:                      490 out of  51,840    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             473
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   16
  Number of route-thrus:                         1
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   135 out of  12,960    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          515
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            45 out of     515    8%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of     515    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         445 out of     515   86%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               2 out of  51,840    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       211 out of     480   43%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
  Number of DSP48Es:                             2 out of      48    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.91
